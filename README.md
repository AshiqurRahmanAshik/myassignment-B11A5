# DevBoard

## Description
DevBoard is a simple task management dashboard built using **HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS**.  
It allows you to track assigned tasks, mark them as completed, see activity logs, and change the website theme color dynamically.

This project is my second web development project where I practiced building a responsive layout and adding interactive features using JavaScript.
